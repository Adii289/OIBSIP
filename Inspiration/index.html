    <p>
      Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the "Missile Man of India," has always been a source of 
      motivation for me. His journey from a small town boy to the President of India is 
      a true example of hard work, humility, and dedication.

    <h2>What I Adore</h2>
    <p>
      I admire his simplicity, honesty, and vision for a developed India. He believed 
      in the power of youth and often said, <em>"Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform 
      into thoughts and thoughts result in action."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      His speeches and books, especially <strong>"Wings of Fire"</strong>, have 
      inspired millions of students, including me, to believe in ourselves and 
      contribute positively to society.
